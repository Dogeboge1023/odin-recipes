<h2>This pepperoni pizza recipe produces a quick and easy classic! Delicious homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce have never been easier.</h2>
<p>REVIEWS:The pizza was scrumptious!!! I used olive oil for the dough (My KitchenAid mixer did most of the mixing) and I baked the pizza on a Pampered chef Stoneware. I added about 3 tablespoon of pizza sauce (store bought - can :)), finely chopped hotdogs, black olives, onions, stuffed string cheese for the edge, 1 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. My family loved it!!! You can make most of the ingredients organic, if you prefer to do it that way :)</p>
